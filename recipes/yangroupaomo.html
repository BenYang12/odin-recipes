    <h1>Yangrou Paomou</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Xiâ€™an, being on the silk road, sits at a fascinating middle ground between east and west, only in this case, west means not Europe but the steppes of Central Asia.</p>
    <p>This soup reflects that heritage: it blends Chinese spices and flavors (ginger, star anise, sichuan peppercorns) with lamb, a very Central Asian meat, and bread. The bread is almost a homestyle flour tortilla or naan, meant to be ripped apart and doused in the soup, to thicken and dissolve in the broth.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
          <li>1 1/2 pounds (3 kg) boneless lamb (mutton, goat or stew-grade beef also work)</li>
        <li>10 cups (litres) beef stock</li>
        <li>1 tsp (5 ml) fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1 tsp (5 ml) Sichuan peppercorns</li>
        <li>2 star anise pods</li>
        <li>1 small stick cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 or 3 dried Thai chiles</li>
        <li>2 inches (5 cm) fresh ginger, smashed</li>
        <li>5 green onions, trimmed, lightly smashed</li>
        <li>1 tsp (5 ml) sea salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups (250 g) flour</li>
        <li>2/3 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 bundles cellophane noodles, soaked in cool water until soft</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dried wood ear mushrooms, soaked in water for at least an hour</li>
        <li>Handful of cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>Chili paste or oil, to taste</li>
        <li>Black vinegar, to taste</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the meat into 1-inch (2 cm) cubes.</li>
        <li>Place the meat in a large Dutch oven or soup pot, cover with water, and boil for about 10 minutes to remove the initial fat.</li>
        <li>Pour out the water and skim off any scum that forms on top.</li>
        <li>Rinse the meat in a colander and rinse out the pot or Dutch oven.</li>
        <li>Return the parboiled meat to the pot and add the stock.</li>
        <li>If you have a mesh spice ball, use it to hold the fennel seeds and Sichuan peppercorns. If not, use cheesecloth tied with twine.</li>
        <li>Add the spice package (or loose spices) to the soup along with star anise, cinnamon, dried chiles, ginger, and green onions.</li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>While the soup is simmering, prepare the bread: mix the flour and baking powder together, then add water and knead into a dough.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and let it rise for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat a wok or frying pan (no oil) to medium-high.</li>
        <li>Take small pieces of dough and roll them into circles about 1/3 inch (less than 1 cm) thick.</li>
        <li>Slap each dough circle onto the hot pan, browning on each side. Set aside. (Like making tortillas, but thicker.)</li>
        <li>Add the soaked noodles and mushrooms to the soup near the end of the cooking time.</li>
        <li>Serve the soup with cilantro, vinegar, and chili sauce as condiments.</li>
        <li>Break the bread into the stew as a thickener, similar to how fritos are used in chili.</li>
    </ol>

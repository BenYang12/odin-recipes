    <img src = "friedboiledpork.jpg" height = "400" width = "450">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fried boiled pork, one of the most famous offerings in traditional Shanxi cuisine, originated during the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-581) among the aristocrats in the southern Shanxi city of Linfen.</p>
    <p>The dish has a bright golden color as well as a tender texture. It is salty, fresh and has sour taste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb pork loin, cut into quarter-sized strips</li>
        <li>1/4 cup onions</li>
        <li>1/4 cup garlic shoots</li>
        <li>1/2 inch knob of ginger, finely sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup rehydrated wood ear mushrooms</li>
        <li>5 tbsp black vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tsp dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp of sweet potato starch</li>
        <li>Canola oil</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>4 tbsp Shaoxing wine</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>3 tbsp sweet potato starch</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
          <li>Marinade the pork loin strips in the marinade sauce.</li>
        <li>Massage the meat until it is tender.</li>
        <li>Heat a wok on high fire. When the wok is hot, add about 2 cups of canola oil. Wait until it hits about 350°F.</li>
        <li>Briefly sauté the pork loin for just a couple of minutes. <strong>Note:</strong> this is not a deep fry dish, the pork should be gently cooked in the oil and taken out before it gets crispy.</li>
        <li>Scoop out the pork and drain the oil on a sieve.</li>
        <li>Empty the wok of excess oil, add about 1 tbsp of canola oil. Turn up heat to medium.</li>
        <li>Throw in the onions, garlic shoots, and ginger and sauté briefly until you can smell the aromatics.</li>
        <li>Add in the pork, wood ear mushrooms, 4 tbsp of black vinegar, 2 tbsp of soy sauce, and 2 tsp of dark soy sauce.</li>
        <li>In a separate small bowl, mix 1/2 tbsp of sweet potato starch with 1 tbsp of water. Then add it to the wok.</li>
        <li>Add about 1/4 cup of water. Adjust accordingly, depending on how dry the stir fry is.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat. Add 1 tbsp of black vinegar.</li>
        <li>Serve by itself or over noodles.</li>
    </ol>
